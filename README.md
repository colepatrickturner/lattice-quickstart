# lattice-quickstart
A quick start boilerplate express server for use with GraphQL Lattice

## What is included
`lattice-quickstart` includes a simple ES6 Express server mated to graphql-lattice to allow for an easy starting point. It includes a single sample type to play with and is, hopefully, well commented. 

### Requirements
The GraphQL Lattice Quickstart app has been tested with Node 6 and Node 8. In order to get started, make sure your environment has at least Node 6 and NPM installed.

*Untested under Windows; file an issue if you have troubles*

### Getting Started
Entering the following in a terminal should pull down the code, install the dependencies and start the server on your localhost at port 9000. 

Once started, you can navigate to http://localhost:9000/graphql to see the GraphiQL interface provided by Facebook.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nyteshade/lattice-quickstart 
cd lattice-quickstart
npm install
./start 
```
